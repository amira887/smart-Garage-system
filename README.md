# Introduction

1- The Smart Garage System is a fusion of technology and convenience, aimed at elevating your garage experience. By utilizing Arduino's capabilities, combined with an array of sensors and components, this system goes beyond the traditional garage to offer advanced features:

2- Intruder Detection: With the help of IR sensors, the system can identify unauthorized entry attempts. When an intruder is detected, the built-in buzzer activates to deter and alert users.

4- Fire Hazard Prevention: Safety is paramount. The integrated flame sensor keeps a watchful eye for potential fire hazards. Should it detect a flame, the system triggers the buzzer, offering a prompt alert to ensure timely action.

# Components

The construction of the Smart Garage System requires the following components:

Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Infrared (IR) Sensors
LCD Display (16x2 )
Buzzer
Flame Sensor
Jumper Wires
Breadboard or PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
Power Supply (5v or as wanted)

# Features

1- Real-time Monitoring: Stay informed with the LCD display providing instant updates on parking space availability.

2- Security Alert: The buzzer serves as a deterrent against unauthorized access while notifying users of potential security breaches.

3- Fire Safety: The dedicated flame sensor ensures rapid detection of fire hazards, triggering the buzzer to issue an early warning.

4- User-friendly Interface: The user interface is intuitive and easy to understand, enabling users to navigate through parking availability and security alerts seamlessly.


# Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Smart Garage System:

Carefully connect the IR sensors, LCD display, buzzer, and flame sensor to the designated pins on the Arduino board. Use the provided pinout diagram for accurate wiring.

Ensure stable connections by attaching the components to a breadboard or PCB.

Mount the flame sensor in a suitable location, optimizing its ability to detect potential fire sources.

Power the Arduino board using an appropriate power supply.

# Usage

Getting the most out of your Smart Garage System is simple:

Power on the Arduino board to initiate the system.

Monitor parking space availability through the LCD display's real-time updates.

If an unauthorized entry is detected, the buzzer will activate, alerting users and deterring potential intruders.

In the event of a fire hazard, the flame sensor's rapid response triggers the buzzer to warn users promptly.
